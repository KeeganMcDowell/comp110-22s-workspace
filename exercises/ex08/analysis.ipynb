    "3. The course should have more, but potentially smaller, programming assignments because they make programming the focus, including hands on use of the language for students.\n",

    "### Part 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "My analysis showed, as is seen by the means, which are not perfect measures of the distribution of the students answers, students feel their performance would not be better in synchronous classes and are not in favor of having the class be returned to synchronous lectures. They generally do believe the lesson videos are effective, giving it close to a 6/7 on average. This shows that, at the very least, the students in the class prefer the current form of teaching and believe that they are performing at their best becuase of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although they do not want it, the proposed change would have students in the seats of the class room more often, which would likely lead to higher grades due to more attention. Other factors are the ability to rewatch lectures, which may allow the students to rewatch over and over, finding particular parts they may need when they need it. The professor and TAs would have to spend more time in the classroom as well, especially with multiple sections, essentially teaching the same material over and over again, so it is inefficient on that front. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem with the validity of the findings is that the data is based on collected surveys with students who have certain agendas/interest in answering in a way. Most students will tell you they would prefer not to have to get out of bed and go to class because every day and may not tell the truth about how the synchronous/asynchronous class difference is affecting their performance. The data that would actually be needed would be a much larger study showing classes who are synchronous and classes that are not fully and comparing their performances against one another. \n"
